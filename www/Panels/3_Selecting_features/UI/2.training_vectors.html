    What is the temporal horizon?
  </p>
  <p>
	The temporal horizon is determined by the user needs. It is equal to the amount of future observations to forecast. The selected amount will be essential in the conformation of the training vectors, stablishing the number of output and the number of neurons on the output layers.
  </p>
  <p>
	How many observations will be needed in the training vectors to obtain the selected output amount?
  </p>
  <p>
	Knowing the temporal horizon the user can define as many options as wanted for the amount of observations that will be taken as inputs.
  </p>
  <p>
	With the defined time horizon and the quantities of selected inputs, different training vectors will be built using the strategy called rolling windows as exposed in <a href = "https://www.mathworks.com/help/econ/rolling-window-estimation-of-state-space-models.html">
	Rolling-Windows Analysis of Time-Series Models</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
	The goal of this is to know how much the obtained results of the models vary in dependency of the training vectors' structure.
